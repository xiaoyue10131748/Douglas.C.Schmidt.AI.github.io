                <h3>Software Development & Industry Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to his academic research/teaching and
                    university/government service, Dr. Schmidt has three decades of
                    experience developing DRE middleware, model-driven engineering tools,
                    and mobile cloud computing apps. He has led the development of the <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ADAPTIVE
                    Communication Environment</a> (ACE), which is a set of <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/users.html">widely used</a>,
                    freely-available object-oriented frameworks that contain a rich set of
                    components that implement patterns for mission-critical DRE systems.
                    Dr. Schmidt and the <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/research-members.html">members</a>
                    of his <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/research-overview.html">research
                    group</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/doc-center.html">Distributed
                    Object Computing (DOC) Group</a> at <a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/">Institute for Software
                    Intensive Systems</a> at Vanderbilt University have used ACE to
                    develop a high performance, real-time CORBA ORB endsystem called <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">The ACE ORB</a>
                    (TAO), which is a <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/corba-research-realtime.html">real-time
                    ORB endsystem</a> that supports end-to-end quality-of-service
                    guarantees over high-speed networks. In turn, ACE and TAO form the
                    basis for the <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/CIAO.html">Component-Integrated
                    ACE ORB</a> (CIAO), which is a real-time <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CCM/">CORBA Component Model</a> (CCM)
                    implementation built by the DOC Group. The DOC Group also developed <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/scoreboard/">CoSMIC</a>, which is
                    a collection of <a href="http://www.isis.v Vanderbilt.edu/Projects/gme/">domain-specific
                    modeling languages</a> and their associated analysis/synthesis tools
                    that support various phases of DRE system development, analysis,
                    configuration, and deployment.

                        The middleware platforms pioneered by Dr. Schmidt constitute some of
                        the most successful examples of software R&amp;D ever transitioned from
                        academia to industry, being <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/users.html">used successfully</a>
                        by thousands of developers in hundreds of companies world-wide,
                        including Defense, Aerospace, Finance, Telecommunications, Medical,
                        Gaming, and Internet industries. In collaboration with his
                        colleagues, Dr. Schmidt has applied these middleware platforms and
                        model-driven tools on large-scale telecommunications systems, medical
                        imaging systems, real-time avionic systems, and distributed
                        interactive simulation systems projects at many companies, including
