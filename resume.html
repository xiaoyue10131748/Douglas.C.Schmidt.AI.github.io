<h3>Research Contributions</h3>



Over the past decade, I have led influential R&D efforts at the
University of California, Irvine; Washington University, St. Louis;
the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA); and Vanderbilt
University.  In these efforts, I have conducted and managed pioneering
research on a range of topics, including patterns, optimization
techniques, and empirical analyses of software frameworks that
facilitate the development of quality of service (QoS)-enabled
middleware and model-driven development (MDD) techniques/tools for
distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems running over
high-speed networks and embedded system interconnects. 
The research agenda throughout my career has involved:
<ul>
<li> Conducting innovative research that created and refined core 
middleware and MDD technologies, such as design formalisms, QoS
specification/enforcement techniques, end-to-end middleware
optimizations, and automated tools for specifying, analyzing, and
synthesizing software from higher-level models and
<li> Working in conjunction with colleagues in academia and
industry to demonstrate and mature middleware technologies in the
context of real-world mission- and life-critical DRE systems, such as
real-time avionics, missile defense, electronic medical imaging,
high-speed network management, distributed interactive simulations,
and teleconferencing.
</ul>

I currently direct the Distributed Object Computing (DOC) group at the
Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) at Vanderbilt
University, which is internationally recognized as one of the leading
research groups on middleware platforms and MDD tools for DRE systems.
The research contributions of my work have involved:
<ul>

<li> Developing innovative optimization techniques, middleware
frameworks and components, and MDD tools that can achieve
high-performance, low latency, and real-time predictability end-to-end
across high-speed networks and embedded interconnects.
<li> Discovering and formalizing patterns and pattern languages to
enhance the development and evolution of middleware and MDD tools to
meet the stringent QoS requirements of DRE systems.
<li> Identifying and alleviating key performance bottlenecks and
sources of priority inversion and non-determinism in middleware
platforms over local-area and wide-area networks.
</ul>

The R&D efforts I have led have had a significant impact on academic
research and commercial practice.  For example, I have published over
300 technical papers and books and am listed as the 135th most cited
computer scientist out of a population of 750,548 authors
(citeseer.ist.psu.edu/allcitedn.html).  Scores of universities
throughout the world also use the middleware and MDD tools my research
group has developed as the basis for their research and teaching
efforts.  Moreover, the middleware platforms and MDD tools developed
in my research group is used by thousands of developers in hundreds of
companies world-wide (including BBN, Boeing, Cisco, Ericsson, Kodak,
Lockheed Martin, Lucent, Motorola, NASA/JPL, Nokia, Nortel, Raytheon,
SAIC, Siemens, Sprint, and Telcordia) for a wide range of projects
(including telecommunications systems, medical imaging systems,
real-time avionic systems, and distributed interactive simulation
systems). 
The remainder of this section describe my research goals and key
contributions in more depth, and cites representative examples of my
publications.  I also summarize my research accomplishments during the
past decade.
<h4>Description of Research Goals and Contributions</h4>

My research on middleware and MDD has produced distributed services,
protocols,and tools that enable DRE systems to invoke operations on
target objects without concern for their location, language, operating
system, or hardware.  Software for these types of applications must be
<em>flexible</em>, <em>efficient</em>, and <em>predictable</em>.
Flexibility is necessary to respond rapidly to application
requirements that span an increasingly wide range of media types and
traffic patterns.  Efficiency and predictability are necessary to
support the QoS demands of performance-sensitive and time-sensitive
DRE systems.
Despite dramatic increases in the performance of networks and
computers, designing and implementing flexible, efficient, and
predictable DRE systems remains hard, and substantial time and effort
is required to develop and deploy these applications today.  My
research has therefore focused on innovative techniques, patterns, and
MDD tools that have improved DRE system development by:
<ul>
<li> Rigorously identifying middleware bottlenecks 
and key sources of priority inversion and non-determinism
<li> Optimizing end-to-end middleware performance and
<li> Simplifying and automating middleware software development,
validation, and evolution.
</ul>

My specific research goals and contributions are described below.
<B>Rigorously identifying performance bottlenecks and sources of
priority inversion and non-determinism in middleware over high-speed
networks and embedded systems interconnects.</B> We have developed and
employed middleware testbed environments to conduct extensive
experiments that systematically identify the performance bottlenecks
and sources of priority inversion and non-determinism in communication
middleware software on high-speed networks.  The experiments in our
testbed have studied <em>lower-level network programming
mechanisms</em>, such as socket-based C interfaces and the C++
wrappers for sockets, and <em>higher-level middleware</em>, such as
Real-time CORBA, which is an open international standard for
distributed object computing that has been highly influenced by the
our R&D on patterns and middleware. 
Our experiments on middleware performance have received widespread
recognition in academia and industry.  As a direct result of the
analysis in our work, for instance, many CORBA suppliers have tuned
their ORB implementations to improve performance considerably.  Thus,
the current generation of Real-time CORBA ORBs are now competitive
with hand-coded C/C++ TCP/IP implementations.  This improvement is
important for performance-sensitive, mission-/life-critical DRE
application domains, such as real-time avionics and high-speed digital
imaging, where the use of higher-level middleware greatly decreases
development effort and increases system reliability and flexibility.

empirical studies of middleware performance include:

<B>Developing innovative optimization techniques and DOC middleware
software that can achieve high-performance, low latency, and real-time
predictability end-to-end.</B> Based on the result of our empirical
performance studies described above, we have developed middleware
optimization techniques that can yield highly efficient and
predictable Object Request Broker (ORB) implementations, without
sacrificing flexibility, reuse, or standards-conformance.  We have
applied and demonstrated these optimization techniques in the context
of:

<ul>
<li> <B>ADAPTIVE Communication Environment</B> (ACE), which is an
object-oriented toolkit containing frameworks and components that
implement key patterns for DRE systems. 
<li> <B>The ACE ORB</B> (TAO), which is a high-performance, real-time
ORB targeted for DRE systems with hard and soft QoS requirements. 
<li> <B>The Component-Integrated ACE ORB</B> (CIAO), which is a
real-time CORBA Component Model (CCM) implementation built on top of
TAO. 
<li> <B>ZEN</B>, which is an implementation of Real-time CORBA
implemented using Real-time Java. 
</ul>

ACE, TAO, CIAO, and ZEN are open-source software that have been used
in thousands of DRE systems around the world.  As a testament to our
prowess in technology transfer, many companies (including OCI,
OOMWorks, PrismTechnologies, Remedy, and Riverace) now provide
commercial support for ACE, TAO, CIAO, and ZEN using an open-source
business model.

<b>Discovering and documenting patterns to simplify the development
and evolution of middleware and applications for DRE systems.</b>
Achieving widespread reuse of middleware requires a concerted focus on
the core <em>patterns</em> that underlie middleware and applications.
Patterns formalize design expertise and articulate time-proven
solutions to forces and problems that arise when developing software.
Patterns also aid the development of middleware and applications by
expressing the structure and collaboration of components at a level
higher than source code or software design models that focus on
individual functions, objects, and classes. 
During the development of ACE, TAO, CIAO, and ZEN, my research group
identified and captured a <em>pattern language</em> of essential
middleware patterns for concurrency and networked collaboration.
These patterns include the <em>Acceptor-Connector</em>, <em>Active
Object</em>, <em>Asynchronous Completion Token</em>, <em>Component
Configurator</em>, <em>Double-Checked Locking Optimization</em>,
<em>Extension Interface</em>, <em>Half-Sync/Half-Async</em>,
<em>Interceptor</em>, <em>Leader/Followers</em>, <em>Monitor
Object</em>, <em>Proactor</em>, <em>Reactor</em>, <em>Scoped
Locking</em>, <em>Strategized Locking</em>, <em>Thread-Safe
Interface</em>, <em>Thread-Specific Storage</em>, and <em>Wrapper
Facade</em>.  Our experience applying these patterns throughout ACE
and TAO illustrates their importance in generating flexible,
efficient, and predictable middleware and application software
architectures for DRE systems. 
Discovering, articulating, and implementing the key patterns via ACE,
TAO, CIAO, and ZEN enabled us to develop middleware that can support
applications with statistical, e.g., multimedia applications, and
deterministic, e.g., avionics flight and mission control systems, QoS
requirements.  When these patterns are reified into reusable software
frameworks and components, they yield middleware that is considerably
more efficient and predictable than is possible using existing
middleware technologies.  In particular, patterns facilitate reuse of
middleware when other forms of reuse are infeasible, e.g., due to
fundamental differences in operating system mechanisms or programming
language features.

<B>Creating and validating model-driven development techniques and
tools.</B> Despite advances in middleware technologies, key challenges
must be overcome to create and validate mission-critical DRE systems
effectively and productively.  For example, developers of DRE systems
continue to use <em>ad hoc</em> means to select and compose their
applications and middleware due to the lack of formally analyzable and
verifiable building block components.  To address these issues, we
have created model-driven development (MDD) techniques and tools can
be used to specify, analyze, optimize, synthesize, validate, and
deploy middleware platforms and applications that can meet the needs
of mission-critical DRE systems.  MDD is an emerging paradigm that
combines
<ul>
<li> <B>Metamodeling</b>, which define type systems that precisely
express key characteristics and constraints associated with particular
DRE system application domains, such as software defined radios,
avionics mission computing, and total ship computing environments. 
<li> <B>Domain-specific modeling languages</B> (DSMLs), which provide
programming notations that formalize the process of specifying
application logic and quality of service (QoS)-related requirements in
DRE systems. 
<li> <B>Model transformations and code generation</B> that automate and
ensure the consistency of software implementations with analysis
information associated with functional and QoS requirements captured
by models of DRE system structure and behavior. 
</ul>

Our work on MDD technologies has focused on CoSMIC, which is an
open-source toolsuite containing an integrated set of MDD tools that
address key lifecycle development challenges of DRE middleware and
applications, such as modeling of DRE system deployment and
configuration capabilities, their QoS requirements, and QoS adaptation
policies used for DRE system QoS management.  The CoSMIC tools enable
developers of DRE systems to specify, develop, compose, and integrate
application and middleware software.

<h3>System Development Experience</h3>
</CENTER>

<ul>

<li> <b> 8/96 -- present: Chief Architect and Systems Programmer</b>
<BR> Used C++ to develop The ACE ORB (<a href="TAO.html">TAO</a>) at
Washington University, St. Louis; University of California, Irvine;
and Vanderbilt University.  TAO uses ACE to provide a high
performance, real-time CORBA ORB endsystem.  TAO is the first <a href="corba-research-realtime.html">real-time ORB endsystem</a> to
support end-to-end Quality of Service guarantees over ATM networks.

 <li> <b> 5/92 -- present: Chief Architect and Systems
Programmer</b> <BR> Used C++ to develop the ADAPTIVE Communication
Environment (<a href="ACE.html">ACE</a>) at the University of
California, Irvine; Washington University, St. Louis; and Vanderbilt
University.  ACE provides a set of object-oriented networking
programming tools that perform event demultiplexing, event handler
dispatching, connection establishment, routing, dynamic
(re)configuration of application services, and concurrency control.
ACE has been ported to many versions of UNIX and Windows NT and is
currently being used on major commercial projects by companies such as
Motorola, Ericsson, Bellcore, Siemens, DEC, and Credit Suisse.  
<li> <b> 1/95 -- present: Systems Architect/Programmer</b> <BR>
Used C++, CORBA, and the ACE toolkit to design and implement the core
distributed services component for Project Spectrum at the Electronic
Radiology Lab (ERL) at the Washington University School of Medicine
and BJC Health System, in collaboration with the industrial partners
IBM/ISSC, Kodak Health Imaging Systems, and Southwestern Bell
Corporation.  Project Spectrum is linking the stand-alone
heterogeneous computer systems of 15 acute care facilities and over
5,500 physicians in the BJC system into a single integrated network.

<li> <b> 10/94 -- present: Systems Analyst/Programmer</b> <BR>
Used CORBA, C++, and the ACE toolkit to design and implement portions
of the distributed systems infrastructure for the Motorola Iridium
project, working as a consultant.  Iridium is a global mobile
communication system that will internetwork 66 low-orbit satellites in
order to provide interconnectivity between personal communications
devices operated throughout the world.

<li> <b> 3/95: Systems Analyst/Programmer</b> <BR>
Used C++ and the ACE toolkit to develop a set of distributed
programming infrastructure tools for a Global Limiting System (GLS)
developed by the Swiss bank Credit Suisse.  GLS is designed to
calculate the real-time exposure of Credit Suisse to market and credit
risks.  GLS is written in C++ and it operates in a distributed
environment linking together several Sun SPARCcenter 2000
multi-processors.

<li> <b> 11/94 -- 2/95: Consultant</b> <BR>
Used C++ and OSI NetExpert to design a network management system for
Edward D. Jones, Inc., working as a consultant.  The Jones network
management system performs automated fault detection, isolation, and
recovery for a large-scale, satellite-based telecommunication network
that links stock brokers throughout North America with the central
data center in St. Louis, MO.

<li> <b> 2/94 -- 9/94: Systems Analyst/Programmer</b><BR>
Used C++, CORBA, HP OpenView, and the ACE toolkit to design and
implement portions of the network management subsystem for the
Motorola Iridium project as a consultant for the ARINC Research
Corporation in Fountain Valley, California.

<li> <b> 11/92 -- Present: Systems Analyst/Programmer</b> <BR>
Used Microsoft Visual C++, Windows NT, and the ACE toolkit to design
and implement portions of the <tt> uStreams</tt> framework, working as a
consultant for Ericsson Business Communications in Cypress,
California.  <tt> uStreams</tt> supports the dynamic configuration of
concurrent, multi-service client/server applications on Windows NT
platforms.  This framework utilizes sophisticated object-oriented
techniques to implement and dynamically configure a family of
applications that monitor and manage the Ericsson MD110 PBX and AXE
telecommunication switches.

<li>  <b> 6/90 -- 11/90: Member of the Technical Staff</b> <BR>
Designed and implemented portions of the <tt> iTRAN</tt> distributed
online transaction processing system at Independence Technologies
Inc. in Fremont, California.  The <tt> iTRAN</tt> system runs across
TCP/IP networks that connect UNIX-based workstations and symmetric
multi-processors. Major contributions included a distributed object
management system written in C++ based upon the ASN.1 data description
language.

<li>  <b> 2/88 -- 6/90: Computing Support Programmer</b> <BR>
Worked for the computer support group at University of California,
Irvine, maintaining GNU compiler and language processing tools
software on a distributed network of Sun workstations, Sequent
multi-processors, and a Convex C240 supercomputer.

<li>  <b> 5/86 -- 9/86: Statistical Programmer/Analyst</b> <BR>
Worked at the National Center for State Courts, Williamsburg, Virginia
on a project concerned with isolating the causes of judicial delay.
This project uses the SPSS statistical analysis package on an IBM 3090
mainframe running TSO.

<li>Developed the ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (<a href="ACE.html">ACE</a>) C++ toolkit.  ACE provides an integrated
framework of reusable C++ wrappers and components that perform common
communication software tasks.  These tasks include event
demultiplexing, event handler dispatching, connection establishment,
routing, dynamic configuration of application services, and
concurrency control.  ACE has been ported to many versions of UNIX and
Win32.  It is currently being used in many commercial products
including the Bellcore and Siemens Q.port ATM signaling software
product, the Ericsson EOS family of telecommunication monitoring
applications, the System Control Segment of the Motorola Iridium
project, high-speed electronic medical image systems for Kodak Health
Imaging Systems and Siemens Medical Engineering, and a family of
avionics products at Boeing.  
<li> Wrote a distributed version of the <tt> rwho</tt> program called <tt>
drwho</tt>.  <tt> drwho</tt> monitors and displays status information on user
and hosts within an internetwork of heterogeneous computers, operating
systems, and networks.

<li> Wrote a LEX-based lexical analyzer and YACC-based parser for the ISO
standard data definition language ASN.1.

<li> Provided many Abstract Data Type (ADT) components for the GNU libg++
class library.

<li> Developed a perfect hash function generator program used to
generate keyword lookup routines for production quality C, C++, Modula
3, Pascal, and <a href="https://www.cs.wm.edu/~dcschmidt/PDF/INFOCOM-99.pdf">CORBA IDL</a> compilers.
This program, GNU <a href="https://www.cs.wm.edu/~dcschmidt/PDF/gperf.pdf">gperf</a>, is now widely
distributed by the Free Software Foundation.


<li> Developed a fast, robust, and reentrant quicksort routine, also
